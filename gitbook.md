To Gitbook:

Hi, I'm R√©mi Vion, the creator of the open-source CushyStudio project a modern and cross-platform software to Play and Work with Generative AI Art.
https://github.com/rvion/cushystudio

This project is completely open-source, free to use, and target developpers amongst others.
I'm looking for a solution to write and host the documentation of the project, and I'm looking for a solution that would allow several open source contributors.
GitBook seems amazing and fit all my requirements:

- ‚úÖ Web-based editor: no need to setup anything; contributors should be able to edit the website online
- ‚úÖ Public version should look like a documentation **website**
- ‚úÖ Hosting solutions available.
- ‚úÖ Ability to insert images/video/other media stuff super easily (drag and dropping in pages)
- ‚úÖ Ability to invite contributors who want to help with the documentation
- ‚úÖ ability to sync to github / generate markdown
- ‚úÖ support my custom-domain (cushystudio.com)

While I'm absolutely ok with paying for a service, I've already invested quite a lot of my savings into this project, and the per-contributor pricing feels a bit stiff for now üòû.
Would you agree in providing me with a free plan that would allow me to invite the core people willing to work on the documentation with me ?

Thanks a lot üôè

R√©mi
