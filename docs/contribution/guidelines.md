  adhere to.

# Guidelines

## Base style guide

We loosely follow the Google Developer documentation styling guidelines,

🚧 copy paste the key bullet points

🚧 add link to their guide

## Enhance pages with LLM.

* if possible, use this prompt: 🚧

```
....
keep it as concise as possible....
be explicit...
```



## Page description guidelines:

* gitbook allow to enter a short pure-text (no bold, ...) page description on each page.
* If possible, add one, but keep it very short.
* be descriptive about what this page is about.

## Naming: prefer one word

* ❌ Cushy SDK, Cushy Apps, Cushy Studio
* 🟢 CushySDK, CushyApps,  CushyStudio

## Page intros

* every page should start with a few oneliners paragraphs about&#x20;
  * one sentence to define stuff&#x20;
  * one sentence per other page that is closely related
    * great way to block things

## Nesting

* level0 top level group index-pages&#x20;
  * should never have unique content. only summary.&#x20;
  * Should have one link to every sub page + at most one or two paragraph (possibly 0)
* level1 page should have one single main topic
  * if a feature have 3 main subfeatures, we add  4 pages. all at the same level, because users will look for any of the 3 main subfeatures as much as the main feature. that also help&#x20;
  *   2 options

      * Only the main feature have the big documentaion, and other pages have one paragrah, one picture, and then point to main page
