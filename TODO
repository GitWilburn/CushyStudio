Migration guide:


- `form.str(...)` has been renamed to `form.string(...)`
- `form.strOpt(...)` has been renamed to `form.stringOpt(...)`
- in various `form.*Opt` variants: `default` property has been renamed to `startActive`
- no more `group: string` param in widget configs, it was anyway unused


---------------------

- stop that crap with optionals at type level => use proper Optional warpper.
    - make it transparent through the formBuilder
    - hoist label automagically.
- properly rewrite group / groupOpt
