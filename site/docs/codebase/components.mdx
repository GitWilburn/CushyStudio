# adding new components

---

there is a built-in `ocomp` snippet that bootstrap a new component.

```ts
ocomp<tab>
```

---

there is a reason why components are ugly like that
has to do with mobx, and debugging, and stuff; some day I'll find a generic way to get rid of that
but for now, I'm happy to let it be. You can just use the ocomp

```ts
//                                                NOTE THE UNDERSCORE HERE
//          first                             second       ðŸ‘‡
//          ðŸ‘‡                                ðŸ‘‡           ðŸ‘‡
export const SelectPopupUI = observer(function SelectPopupUI_<T>(p: { s: AutoCompleteSelectState<T> }) {
```
