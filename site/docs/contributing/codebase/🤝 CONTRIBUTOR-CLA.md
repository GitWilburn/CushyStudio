### Welcome to the `CushyStudio` Contributor Family!

First off, a big thank you for considering contributing to `CushyStudio`. Every contribution, big or small, enriches our community and gets us one step closer to our shared vision.

This Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a little formality we need to go through to ensure the integrity of `CushyStudio` for everyone involved. Let's get through this together.

Just so it's clear: this CLA is solely about contributions to the main repository, not your individual creations, custom actions, or the art you craft with `CushyStudio`.

#### Why Do We Need This Agreement?

-   **For you**: It ensures your contributions are recognized and establishes clarity about how they can be used.
-   **For `CushyStudio` and its users**: It ensures that the rights around the contributed code are clear and prevent any potential hiccups down the road.
-   **For meÂ (rvion)**: This ensures that I can utilize your contributions to enhance `CushyStudio`, such as by offering cloud GPU services or other community-friendly features to support the project. Please review the CLA summary for details. And remember, `CushyStudio` remains a free, open-source initiative, with plans to transition to GPLV3 in the future.

#### What's Expected from Our Contributors?

1. If you're contributing more than just a minor tweak (think more than a line or two), I'll need you to sign this CLA. It's a one-time thing.
2. If, for some reason, you can't sign this CLA, I might not be able to accept your contribution.

Version 2.0 â€“ Dated 2023-10-29

#### Our Agreement:

1. **Your Contribution**: By signing below, you're giving me, RÃ©mi Vion (aka rvion on Github), the green light to use your contributions for enhancing `CushyStudio` and providing associated services. Formally, this means granting a perpetual, non-exclusive, global, and royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and build upon your work.

2. **You've Got the Power**: By signing, you're saying you're legally allowed to make this contribution. If someone else, like an employer, has rights to what you're contributing, please make sure they're okay with this before signing.

3. **Your Original Work**: Please ensure what you're contributing is genuinely yours. If there's any doubt or potential conflict, please reach out, and we can clarify things together.

4. **Inclusion in the Project**: Whether your contribution makes it to the final cut is up to me. But know this â€“ every contribution is valuable, and we appreciate your effort.

5. **No Hidden Strings Attached**: Unless explicitly stated here, your contribution comes as-is, with no warranties. That said, we trust and value the quality of contributions from our community.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

In case you want to know more about the CLA, here are some answers to questions you might have:
If your questions are not covered, you can take a look at the full FAQ: https://github.com/rvion/CushyStudio/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md

### Q: Will `CushyStudio` remain open source and free?

**A**: Absolutely! I'm committed to keeping `CushyStudio` 100% open source and free. Create assets, art, games â€“ you name it. It's your creation, and I'm just here to help you make it.

### Q: Why the AGPL and not the GPLV3?

**A**: For now, `CushyStudio` is licensed under AGPL as I aim to guide the project towards sustainability. I plan to transition to GPLV3 in the future, once the project achieves a stable foundation. This choice is designed to safeguard the project and its dedicated community. Rest assured, utilizing `CushyStudio` for asset creation remains unrestricted. My primary intention is to prevent the unauthorized resale or commercialization of `CushyStudio` as a service.

### Q: Any plans for a paid version of `CushyStudio`?

**A**: No, and that's a promise. `CushyStudio` will always be free and open source. While I do have plans to offer complementary services (like cloud GPU services), the core of `CushyStudio` will remain free for all. Again, I simply wish to prevent unauthorized resale or commercialization of `CushyStudio` as a service.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in going through this agreement. Together, let's make `CushyStudio` better for everyone! ðŸ’ªðŸŽ‰
